# Molecular networking applied to toxicology

## Overview

This project consists of 5 modules to facilitate the analysis of mass spectrometry data by molecular networking :
- **Metabolites**: annotation of molecules in a .clustersummary file from the GNPS site from a reference file.
- **Biotransformation**: annotates the links in a .selfloop file from the GNPS site with the biotransformations corresponding to the mass difference between the molecules.
- ***InSilico***: *in silico* prediction of a list of molecules whose SMILES code is provided by 3 software packages (BioTransformer3, SyGMa, MetaTrans).
- **MetGem**: allows export to Cytoscape of molecular network link information generated by the MetGem software.
- **ProteoWizard**: converts mass spectrometry data from proprietary to open formats. Uses the docker version to run on a Linux system.

## Installation

Various packages are required :
- **Zenity** `apt install zenity`

=> As this project was designed for non-bioinformaticians, a graphical interface via zenity was included. However, the various scripts can be used separately.

- **bc command** `apt install bc`
- **gawk** `apt install gawk`
- **csvkit** `apt install csvkit`
- **Java** `apt install default-jre`
- **Docker** (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
- **Conda** (https://github.com/conda/conda)

Unzip the **Tools** folder and place the following folder in it: 
- **Biotranformer3.0** folder containing the various files of Biotransformer3 (see link below). Rename the **Biotranformer3.0.jar**.
- **MetaTrans-master** folder containing the various files of MetaTrans (see link below)

Set **Main.sh** to the root of this folder

## Instruction

Make the script Main.sh executable `chmod +x Main.sh`

Run the Main.sh `./Main.sh`
